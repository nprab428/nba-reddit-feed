# thunder-reddit-feed

This is my personalized filter on r/nba posts. Since my favorite team is the Oklahoma City Thunder, I've made some default keywords that filter to their relevant posts.

As seen in the gif, the default keywords are "westbrook", "thunder", and "okc". On page load, it pulls all posts whose title contains those specified keywords.

The search box is dynamic, and can accomodate any search term. For example, if I wanted to search for just posts about "lebron", I could make that the only tag and then submit for new results.

There isn't any new functionality here on top of what Reddit already offers. This serves mainly as a practice project for me to play around with Node, Express, React, and the Snoowrap reddit API.
